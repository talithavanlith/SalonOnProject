        <h2>Project</h2>
        <h3>Project Summary:</h3>
        <p>SalonOn will be a booking app that will allow salons to generate sales off of otherwise empty seats. Clients will be able to sign up and be matched with stylists in the area who fit their hair needs. Together they are able to choose a salon location
            that works for them.</p>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>For beginning stylists, it is difficult to transition from running their businesses out of their homes to working at a rented booth in a salon due to economic feasibility. What can a stylist do when they have reached the point where they have
            too many clients to accommodate from their home adequately, but not enough clientele to justify the financial overhead for a stylist to rent a chair from a salon for weeks at a time? The solution is SalonOn - an Android and IOS app designed
            to connect stylists with salon owners with empty chairs for a few hours and connect stylists with clients. The objective is to provide the professional quality experience for the clientele while mitigating the financial impact on the stylists,
            as well as increase revenue for salon owners. A win-win-win situation!</p>
        <p>The target users for this product will be salon owners, beginning stylists, and customers. The customers can enjoy a professional salon experience with their preferred stylist, while the stylist can increase their customer base with less financial
            risk, and salon owners can increase their revenue on chairs that are sitting empty and not yielding maximum income. </p>
        <p>This product is being created for Morgan Auriel Kee, a hairstylist from the Chapel Hill area. This app would be important for helping beginning stylists grow their careers and increase their revenue by helping them build their clientele. The app
            would also support small business owners of salons to fill empty seats and maximize their profits and offset overhead losses caused by empty booths. Finally, the app would also be a great convenience to consumers who want to get their hair
            done by skilled stylists at a suitable time and place that can provide them all the conveniences and services typically available only at salons due to the restrictions of space and financial output for specialized furniture and equipment.</p>
        <p>The primary goals of this project are threefold: to create a proof of concept of the clientâ€™s vision that she can present to her investors; to design functionality that allows the app to connect salon owners who have empty chairs with stylists;
            and to establish a system that connects stylists with customers.</p>
