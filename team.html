        <h3>Team behavior rules:</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Team members are expected to exhibit professional and friendly behavior. Hurtful, rude, or passive aggressive attitudes will be reported to the professor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a team member is to miss a meeting they should notify the other members ahead of time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no enforced minimum time warning, but each member should respect the time of others, and make the group aware as soon as they are able.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each team member is expected to limit their number of absences to a minimum throughout the semester, any more than 3 should require a legitimate excuse(family matter, illness, etc)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Team members will be in consistent communication with each other via group chat as frequently as necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generally, with inquiries related to the project, responses shouldnâ€™t take longer than 24 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a team team member becomes unresponsive for longer that 24 hours regarding a matter would delay progress, or prevent another member from continuing work, then they forfeit their input on the matter to the remaining team members.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask for help! Team members are discouraged from struggling with features or topics that they feel uncomfortable, or out of their depth with. There is nothing wrong with experimenting with new resources, but if you hit a dead end, make it known to the
                    team, and see if anyone else has a better understanding or method before you continue solo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the team fails to reach a census on a decision, majority rule will decide the outcome. In cases where the team becomes divided, the opinion of the mentor will break the tie and decide the best progression forward.
                </li>
            </ol>
