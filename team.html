        <h3>Team behavior rules:</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Team members are expected to exhibit professional and friendly behavior. Hurtful, rude, or passive aggressive attitudes will be reported to the professor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a team member is to miss a meeting they should notify the other members ahead of time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no enforced minimum time warning, but each member should respect the time of others, and make the group aware as soon as they are able.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each team member is expected to limit their number of absences to a minimum throughout the semester, any more than 3 should require a legitimate excuse(family matter, illness, etc)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Team members will be in consistent communication with each other via group chat as frequently as necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generally, with inquiries related to the project, responses shouldn’t take longer than 24 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a team team member becomes unresponsive for longer that 24 hours regarding a matter would delay progress, or prevent another member from continuing work, then they forfeit their input on the matter to the remaining team members.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask for help! Team members are discouraged from struggling with features or topics that they feel uncomfortable, or out of their depth with. There is nothing wrong with experimenting with new resources, but if you hit a dead end, make it known to the
                    team, and see if anyone else has a better understanding or method before you continue solo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the team fails to reach a census on a decision, majority rule will decide the outcome. In cases where the team becomes divided, the opinion of the mentor will break the tie and decide the best progression forward.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Team code style:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul id="codeStyle">
                <li>
                    <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide">Kotlin style guide</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://google.github.io/swift/">Swift style guide</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://standardjs.com">Swift style guideJavascript style package</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Java style guide</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let’s stick to these as a general rule, but if we have problems with them we can discuss what we’d like to change about them.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Team git style:</h3>
        <p>
            We will use <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Git Flow</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically, we will mostly operate on a “develop” branch. When we want to add features, we will create a feature branch like ‘feature/feature name’. When it’s ready to be merged into the develop branch, we will do pull requests. In a pull request, all
            of the changes that you have been made are made visible on github to the rest of the team. At this point, at least one other team member should review that pull request. During this process other team members can ask questions and make comments
            about any of the changes that have been made. When at least one other person approves, they can mark the pull request as approved and the author of the changes can merge them into the develop branch. When we want to publish our changes, we
            can create a release branch with all of the changes until that point.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will ikely use Android Studio’s built in GitHub integration.
