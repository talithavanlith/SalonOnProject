        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <h3>User Stories we must have in our project:</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to record information about hair, payment, and location preferences, I can create a profile on the app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to know if my stylist is certified for the services they perform, I can see the credentials of the stylists that I book. </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to provide information about what type of hair I have, and be matched with stylists who specialize in that particular type of hair, I can record my hair type in a category of either: straight, thin, thick, or curly. </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to be conveniently matched to a stylist and salon close to me, I can specify the location radius where I want to get my hair done. </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to specify how I like my hair to be done, I can list the styles I like my hair to be in my profile. </li>
                <li>
                    As I client, in order to be matched with the appropriate stylist, I can select the services I want a stylist to be able to do when I query for a stylist.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to make sure I can attend my appointment, I can request salons that meet my accessibility needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a stylist and salon owner, in order to verify myself to my customers, I can present proof of my license/business in the app to get verified. </li>
                <li>
                    As a stylist, in order to give clients and salons an idea of how long an appointment will be, I can list how long services take me to perform. </li>
                <li>
                    As a stylist, in order to be matched with clients that I am best suited to work with, I can create a profile that describes the hair types I work with, the locations I am willing to travel to for work and the styles I specialize in. </li>
                <li>
                    As a stylist, in order to display my previous work, I can upload photos of my work to my profile with an in-app photo gallery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a stylist, in order to have control over who I work with, and what jobs I take, I need to be able to accept or decline client requests within the app. </li>
                <li>
                    As a stylist, in order to ensure the salon has the correct details on my appointment and doesnâ€™t double book my appointment, I can schedule my appointment in the calendar of the salon. </li>
                <li>
                    As a salon owner, in order to advertise to stylists which booths I have available when and for what price, I can use a built-in calendar in the app (that is linked to Calendly) that I can upload my available booths and their prices to. </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>User Stories that would be good to include in the project if we get the time:</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    As a stylist, in order to know what services can be done at a particular salon, I can see what equipment the salon provides when I attempt to book it. </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to assist other clients in deciding on whether or not to use a stylist I used, I can leave reviews and additional comments on my stylist after I get a haircut with them. </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to pay for my services, I can use my credit card to pay my stylist.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to make sure a salon location is acceptable to me, I can approve a salon location a stylist attempts to book before the salon is officially reserved. </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to be conveniently reminded of when I should book another salon appointment, I can receive notifications reminding me to get my hair done again. </li>
                <li>
                    As a client, in order to encourage me to use the app more frequently, I can gain levels after using the app which could net me special offers and discounts.
                </li>
            </ol>
